# aes-gui
A tool for encrypting and decrypting text securely with a graphical user interface.

## About
This tool allows an input text to be encrypted or decrypted using password based encryption. This is done by using PBKDF2 to derive a unique AES256 key from the master password for each encrypted message.

All of the code for this encryption runs client side in the browser.

## Usage
This is a web version of the aes-gui application and can be accessed from [this link](https://removingnest109.github.io/eframe-aes-gui/)
